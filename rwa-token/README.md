## RWA Tokenization

## Overview

This project implements smart contracts for the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs) and their subsequent lending on a blockchain platform. The contracts facilitate the creation, management, and lending of asset-backed tokens, ensuring security and transparency in the transaction process.

## Features

- **Tokenization of RWAs**: Convert real-world assets into fungible tokens that can be easily traded or lent.
- **Lending Mechanism**: Enable users to lend their tokenized assets and earn interest.
- **Collateral Management**: Handle collateral requirements for loans to mitigate risk.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring traceability and security.
